     *
     * "Compose" multiplies the probabilities of the indepedent permutation

     * Measures the qubit at "qubitIndex" and returns either "true" or "false."
     * (This "gate" breaks unitarity.)
     *
     * All physical evolution of a quantum state should be "unitary," except
     * measurement. Measurement of a qubit "collapses" the quantum state into
     * either only permutation states consistent with a |0> state for the bit,
     * or else only permutation states consistent with a |1> state for the bit.
     * Measurement also effectively multiplies the overall quantum state vector
     * of the system by a random phase factor, equiprobable over all possible
     * phase angles.
     *
     * Effectively, when a bit measurement is emulated, Qrack calculates the
     * norm of all permutation state components, to find their respective
     * probabilities. The probabilities of all states in which the measured
     * bit is "0" can be summed to give the probability of the bit being "0,"
     * and separately the probabilities of all states in which the measured
     * bit is "1" can be summed to give the probability of the bit being "1."
     * To simulate measurement, a random float between 0 and 1 is compared to
     * the sum of the probability of all permutation states in which the bit
     * is equal to "1". Depending on whether the random float is higher or
     * lower than the probability, the qubit is determined to be either |0> or
     * |1>, (up to phase). If the bit is determined to be |1>, then all
     * permutation eigenstates in which the bit would be equal to |0> have
     * their probability set to zero, and vice versa if the bit is determined
     * to be |0>. Then, all remaining permutation states with nonzero
     * probability are linearly rescaled so that the total probability of all
     * permutation states is again "normalized" to exactly 100% or 1, (within
     * double precision rounding error). Physically, the act of measurement
     * should introduce an overall random phase factor on the state vector,
     * which is emulated by generating another constantly distributed random
     * float to select a phase angle between 0 and 2 * Pi.
     *
     * Measurement breaks unitary evolution of state. All quantum gates except
     * measurement should generally act as a unitary matrix on a permutation
     * state vector. (Note that Boolean comparison convenience methods in Qrack
     * such as "AND," "OR," and "XOR" employ the measurement operation in the
     * act of first clearing output bits before filling them with the result of
     * comparison, and these convenience methods therefore break unitary
     * evolution of state, but in a physically realistic way. Comparable
     * unitary operations would be performed with a combination of X and CCNOT
     * gates, also called "Toffoli" gates, but the output bits would have to be
